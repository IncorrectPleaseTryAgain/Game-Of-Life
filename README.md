# Game-Of-Life
Simple game of life simulation

## Description
This projects takes inspiration from [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The program starts by giving the user a blank grid which they can use to toggle cells on/off. Once the simulation starts the cells behave in accordance to three simple rules. [1]

----

## Three Simple Rules
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives. [1]
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell. [1]
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead. [1]
